## Daily Log
Day 1 (16/07/2024): I saw 30 minutes of the video [Linear Algebra in AI](https://youtu.be/3Bf9oh7nkus?si=NMlsASKlCnneRoVZ). Then, I saw the introduction of the course [Complete A.I. & Machine Learning, Data Science Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-machine-learning-and-data-science-zero-to-mastery/).

Day 2 (17/07/2024): I finished sections 2, 3 and 4 of the course and took notes mostly types of data and basic concepts. I watched the introduction of the couse [The Data Science Course: Complete Data Science Bootcamp 2024
](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-data-science-course-complete-data-science-bootcamp/). I decided that I'm going to follow the Python path.

Day 3 (18/07/2024): I finished the instalation of the Jupyter Notebook after 2 hours of sacrifice and learned the basics of Python until operator precedence.

Day 4 (19/07/2024): I learned about Variables, Strings, Booleans until the beginning of Lists.

Day 5 (20/07/2024): I finished the section 1 about python, but also did some extra external exercises from W3schools to practice all the content of the section until sets.

Day 6 (21/07/2024): I learned about conditions, loops with for and while, break, continue, pass.

Day 7 (22/07/2024): I finished the section 2 about python, did the recomended exams from w3schools: [25 questions](https://www.w3schools.com/quiztest/quiztest.asp?qtest=PYTHON) and [95 questions](https://www.w3schools.com/python/exercise.asp). Besides, I searched about modules and classes in Python.
