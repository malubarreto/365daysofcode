## Daily Log
Day 1 (16/07/2024): I saw 30 minutes of the video [Linear Algebra in AI](https://youtu.be/3Bf9oh7nkus?si=NMlsASKlCnneRoVZ). Then, I saw the introduction of the course [Complete A.I. & Machine Learning, Data Science Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-machine-learning-and-data-science-zero-to-mastery/).

Day 2 (17/07/2024): I finished sections 2, 3 and 4 of the course and took notes mostly types of data and basic concepts. I watched the introduction of the couse [The Data Science Course: Complete Data Science Bootcamp 2024
](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-data-science-course-complete-data-science-bootcamp/). I decided that I'm going to follow the Python path.

Day 3 (18/07/2024): I finished the instalation of the Jupyter Notebook after 2 hours of sacrifice and learned the basics of Python until operator precedence.

Day 4 (19/07/2024): I learned about Variables, Strings, Booleans until the beginning of Lists.
