# 365 Days Of Code (16/07/2024 - ?)
This is a repository of my experience in 365 Days Of Code. Each project listed below represents a day (or days) of dedication and learning.

## Progress Of Day
All the progress of the day, the things that I think are relevant to take notes are here: [365DaysOfMachineLearning](https://smart-reaper-1c5.notion.site/365-Days-Of-Machine-Learning-ad8aa1ae8287449da38d0bc2fd44b3f9)

## Daily Log
Day 1 (16/07/2024): I saw 30 minutes of the video [Linear Algebra in AI](https://youtu.be/3Bf9oh7nkus?si=NMlsASKlCnneRoVZ). Then, I saw the introduction of the course [Complete A.I. & Machine Learning, Data Science Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-machine-learning-and-data-science-zero-to-mastery/).

Day 2 (17/07/2024): I finished sections 2, 3 and 4 of the course and took notes mostly types of data and basic concepts. I watched the introduction of the couse [The Data Science Course: Complete Data Science Bootcamp 2024
](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-data-science-course-complete-data-science-bootcamp/). I decided that I'm going to follow the Python path.

Day 3 (18/07/2024): I finished the instalation of the Jupyter Notebook after 2 hours of sacrifice and learned the basics of Python until operator precedence.

Day 4 (19/07/2024): I learned about Variables, Strings, Booleans until the beginning of Lists.

Day 5 (20/07/2024): I finished the section 1 about python, but also did some extra external exercises from W3schools to practice all the content of the section until sets.

Day 6 (21/07/2024): I learned about conditions, loops with for and while, break, continue, pass.

Day 7 (22/07/2024): I finished the section 2 about python, did the recomended exams from w3schools: [25 questions](https://www.w3schools.com/quiztest/quiztest.asp?qtest=PYTHON) and [95 questions](https://www.w3schools.com/python/exercise.asp). Besides, I searched about modules and classes in Python.

Day 8 (23/07/2024): I finished section 6 about pandas, learned how to import a csv file, some basic methods and did the exercises, but not all of them.

Day 9 (24/07/2024): I did the easy exercises from a [video](https://youtu.be/i7v2m-ebXB4?si=Jl9ziOIVKU8--XOj) doing [100 pandas exercises](https://github.com/ajcr/100-pandas-puzzles). Then, I started section 7 about numpy in the Data Science course.

Day 10 (25/07/2024): I had a busy day so I focused on a revision of the past days, but also continued the lesson about numpy.

Day 11 (26/07/2024): I continued the numpy section, but didn't finish.

Day 12 (27/07/2024): Today I started seeing a little bit of math, but not too much. I started the playlist [Essence of linear algebra](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNk_zzaMoSs&list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab&pp=iAQB) on Youtube and then saw a little bit of [Calculus 1 with Kan Academy Platform](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1). I continued the numpy section, I think it's the most exhausting, because I'm finding it difficult to understand.

Day 13 (28/07/2024): I finished section 7 about numpy.

Day 14 (29/07/2024): I did exercises and read the documentation of numpy and then started section 8 of matplotlib.

Day 15 (30/07/2024): To be different I continued the other course [The Data Science Course: Complete Data Science Bootcamp 2024
](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-data-science-course-complete-data-science-bootcamp/). Then, I watched the first [video about Neural Networks](https://youtu.be/aircAruvnKk?si=5ipzKpFHZykjTtfU).

Day 16 (31/07/2024): I started to read a book about Data Science.

Day 17 (01/08/2024): I continued the section 8 about matplotlib, learned the basic workflow of matplotlib.

Day 18 (02/08/2024): I continued the section 8 about matplotlib, learned abou histograms, subplots and how to plotting from pandas DataFrames.

Day 19 (03/08/2024): I finished the section 8 about matplotlib.

Day 20 (04/08/2024): I learned about local and global scope and did a project about number guessing.

Day 21 (05/08/2024): I learned about debugging and did a higher or lower game about influencers on Instagram. I also started the project about coffee machine.
